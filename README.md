# Demonstration
The objective is to retrieve a spreadsheet containing several mailing addresses, and then verify those addresses using the USPS website. The output file contains all the same data as the input, with the addition of a column stating the valitidy of each address.
In the event a request fails, the response code will be written in place of the address validity rather than a false positive.
